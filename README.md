*.data section of the program
1. Proceed to /sample_images or proceed to the file in which you have a test image, and right click on it.
2. Select 'Copy Path'.
3. Paste this path between the quotation marks in line with the variable "filename" - If the path copied contained backslashes, and therefore, does not open, replace the backlashes with forward slashes.
4. Procced to the /output files directory and choose an output .ppm file. NB, you can try and match the title of the input image to the title of the created .ppm file. e.g house_64_in_ascii_lf.ppm -> increase_brightness_House.ppm
5. Copy the absolute path of the output file.
6. Paste this path between the quotation marks in line with the variable "outputFile". - If the path copied contained backslashes, and therefore, does not open, replace the backlashes with forward slashes.
7. Done! You may run using QTSpim.
NB! Please use an lf file when inputing an image (not cr or crlf file).
